        <p id="text">John 1:12-18 ,We have to believe in Jesus Christ our Savior, who came by the gospel Truth of the water and the Spirit, in order to receive salvation from all our sins. John 1:10 says, “He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.” Here, the phrase “He was in the world” implies that Jesus Christ has actually existed in this world. The Lord is the Creator of this world. Thus, the Creator of this world came to the creatures He had created and lived together with among them. However, everyone in this world, not even the Jews, recognized Him as the Savior.</p>

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, ‘This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’’ And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.”</p>
